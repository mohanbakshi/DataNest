## Introduction

This repository contains various projects focused on data analysis and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. The primary goal is to demonstrate my ability to handle different datasets, create a datamart, and automate ETL tasks using Bash scripting.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Analysis
- **Description**: Analysis of various datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### 2. Datamart Creation
- **Description**: Designing and implementing a datamart to support business intelligence and reporting needs.
- **Tools Used**: SQL, Python.

### 3. ETL Process
- **Description**: Automating the ETL process using Bash scripting to ensure efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Tools Used**: Bash, Python, SQL.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:mohanbakshi/PACE.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

## Datasets

The datasets used in this repository are publicly available.

## ETL Process

The ETL scripts are located in the `BASH SCRIPTING ETL` directory. These scripts are designed to automate the data extraction, transformation, and loading processes. To execute the ETL process, navigate to the `BASH SCRIPTING ETL` directory and run the following command:

```sh
bash covid_data_assignment.sh
```
Or
```sh
bash airport_data_assignment.sh
```

## Data Analysis

The data analysis notebooks and scripts can be found in the data-analysis directory. Each script is well-documented to explain the steps and methods used for analysis.
